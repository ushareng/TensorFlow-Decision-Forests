# TensorFlow-Decision-Forests

TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF) is a library to train, run and interpret decision forest models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees) in TensorFlow. TF-DF supports classification, regression, ranking and uplifting. This tutorial explains the following content

1. Build , Train and Evaluate a model

2. Proximities and Prototypes with Random Forest

3. Automated Hyperparameter Tuning
